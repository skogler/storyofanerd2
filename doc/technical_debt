= Logging =

* Logging: Create ENTER_FUNCTIONS / QUIT_FUNCTION macros
* Only use in public functions

= Other =

* Consider creating typedefs for shared_pointer<XXX>
* Fix viewport limiting by making map size and WINDOW SIZE dynamic
* check std11 features:
    * consider std::move? (see goingnative2013)
    * maybe other features available?
* check compiler flags for warnings
* compilation also with clang
* Map is currently done the lazy way, must support multiple layers

= Major Reworks =

* Keep quadtree (or other spatial representation) of game data (so that not
  everything gets drawn / collision detected)
* Dont use singletons
